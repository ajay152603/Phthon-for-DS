Amit Sethi Message for young asperents of ML:
One of the best resources out there on mathematics for machine learning is a book by this very name: Mathematics for Machine Learning by Deisenroth, Faisal, and Ong. [https://shorturl.at/hlCRY]. In that, for now, please read the following sections: 2.1 - 2.3, 3.1-3.4, 5.1-5.2, 6.1-6.5, 7.1, in that order of importance. I apologize for the errors in the third-party video from Edureka that I posted with the intention to ease your self-study by watching a video instead of reading a paper or a book. The lesson learned for me is that sometimes it is best to stick to written material from reputable sources.
Also, do check out some free videos from a company that teaches working professionals for a premium: https://www.greatlearning.in/academy. There is some good material on python for ML, ML, and DL in there.
Full disclosure: Prof. Arjun Jain and I have taught a few modules for this company
